    -> AWS - Amazon Web Services 

        -> Cloud Computing 

            -> Application has data 

                -> Data is in server (database,web, file storage etc )

                    -> Server 

                        -> Server is an machine where, Applications run 

                        -> Server is a computer system, that takes a request
                            and sends response 

                    -> Where is this Server ? 

                        -> Servers are hosted in Datacenters 

    -> Data Center 

        -> A data center is a building, a dedicated space within a building, 
        or a group of buildings used to house computer systems and 
        associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems.

    -> Physical Data Centers are Expensive & Hard To Maintain 

    -> Cloud Computing
    
        -> ‘The Cloud’ can also refer to Cloud computing is the 
        "on-demand" availability of compute power, database storage, 
        applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform 
        (AWS/AZURE/GCP/Oracle etc) via the "internet" with "pay-as-you-go" pricing.

        -> Cloud Computing is comparable to Online Ride Services 

    -> Cloud Offerings

        -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS 

            -> Hardware (2 cpu - 4 GB ram - 500 GB SSD)

        -> Platform As A Service - PAAS 

            -> Database Platform (MySQL Database, NoSQL Database, Java Application Platform)

        -> Software As A Service - SAAS 

            -> Direct Softwares (subscribe and pay)

        -> NOTE: Compare them to Online Ride Services like 
                    Uber: Bikes, Cars, Autos etc


16th Dec 2025
=============

    -> Traditional Approach (Setting Up Application Infrastructure On Physical Datacenters)

        -> Amazon Ecommerce Application 

            -> Servers 
                +
            -> Storage 
                +
            -> Databases 
                +
            -> Networking 
                +
            -> Security 
                +
            -> etc 

    -> New Approach (Setting Up Application Infrastructure On Cloud Datacenters (AWS))

        -> Amazon Ecommerce Application 

            -> Servers      -   AWS EC2
                +                  +
            -> Storage      -   AWS S3 
                +                  +
            -> Databases    -   AWS RDS        ======>    Application
                +                  +
            -> Networking   -   AWS VPC 
                +                  +
            -> Security     -   AWS IAM
                +                  +
            -> etc          -   AWS etc 


    -> Application should have following characteristics (Four Pillars Of Cloud)

        -> Highly Available 

            -> High availability in AWS ensures that applications are 
                continuously accessible and operational

        -> Fault Tolerant 

            -> Fault tolerance in AWS refers to the ability of a system to 
                continue operating without interruption in the face of hardware failures

        -> Secured 

            -> Security in AWS refers to the measures taken to protect cloud resources, 
                data, and applications from unauthorized access.

        -> Scalable  

            -> Scalability in AWS refers to the ability of a system to handle 
                increasing workloads and accommodate growing demands. 


    -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS 

        -> AWS Global Infrastructure 

            -> Amazon Cloud Computing resources (servers, storage, databases etc) 
            are available across the world. 
            In simple terms if we see this https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/ 
            then Amazon Data Centers are available in different geographical locations.

        -> In terms of AWS, infrastructure is made up of 

            -> Regions 

            -> Availability Zones 

            -> Edge locations

        -> Regions

            -> Regions are designed to service AWS customers (or your users) 
                that are located closest to a region.

            -> Availability of Services are different for different AWS Regions.

            -> Price varies from region to region

17th Dec 2025
=============

    -> Availability zone (AZ)

        -> Availability zone is where the actual data centers are located

        -> Within a Region, there can be multiple Availability zones

        -> Each AZ has independent Power Supply, Networking, Cooling System, Physical Security.

        -> https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan_Beres/publication/360541079/figure/fig1/AS:1154856056291328@1652350548135/AWS-Regions-and-Availability-Zones-Scott-nd.ppm

    
    -> Edge locations

        -> An AWS Edge Location is a data center in the AWS global network used by services 
        like CloudFront, Global Accelerator, and Lambda@Edge to store cached content 
        (images, videos) and process requests closer to end-users, 
        drastically reducing latency by serving data from the nearest point of presence(pop) 
        rather than a distant main AWS Region. 
        They act as caching warehouses, improving performance for websites.

    -> VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

        -> A Virtual Private Cloud is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted 
        within a public cloud. 

        -> VPC customers can run code, store data, host websites & applications in isolated mode

        -> NOTE: Having VPC is similar to having your own data center inside AWS. 

        -> VPC is a service that lets customers(IBM) provision a logically isolated 
        section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources(Servers) 
        in a VIRTUAL NETWORK that you define.


18th Dec 2025
=============

    -> VPC Architecture Reference 

        -> https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFI8sqvP4xFFQ/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1700537758681?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=zE97TFGw5FQJEjUksqx7SohNsqqV57-IYQ_pj7K2M2U

    -> VPC components

        -> Internet Gateway (Gate For Building)

            -> An Internet Gateway must be attached to a VPC if the resources inside the VPC 
                need to connect to resources via the open internet.

        -> Subnets (Floors In Building)

            -> A subnet or sub network is an logical subdivision of an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

        -> Route Tables (Lift In Building)

            -> A route table contains a set of rules called routes, 
                that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

        -> Network Access Control List - NACL (Watchman For Floor)

            -> subnet-level firewall that acts as an optional security layer 

        -> Security Group (Watchman For Flat)

            -> server-level firewall which is mandatory

19th Dec 2025
=============

    -> VPC Workflow 

        -> "To enable access to or from the internet to an instance(server) in a VPC subnet, 
        you must attach an Internet gateway to your VPC, 
        ensure that your subnet route table points to the Internet gateway and 
        ensure that instance has a public IP address, 
        and ensure that your network access control and security group rules 
        allow the relevant traffic to your instance" -- AWS

0th Dec 2025
=============

    -> VPC Workflow & Components Demo

        -> Detach Internet Gateway 

            -> Proceeding with this action will detach the internet gateway from VPC. 
            If you detach the internet gateway, resources in the VPC 
            cannot communicate with the internet. 
        
        -> Attach Internet Gateway 

            -> Attach an internet gateway to a VPC to enable the VPC to communicate with the internet. 

        -> Route Table & Subnet 

            -> RT connects to subnet and shows the network path 

            -> Inside RT We have routes 

                -> local - within vpc 
                -> internet route - outside vpc (removed)

                -> Adding back a proper route i.e internet route, will fix issue 

        -> NACL - Network Access Control List 

            -> Firewall on Subnet Level, allows all traffic 

            -> Let's modify NACL to block all traffic and verify connectivity 

                -> Select Instance -> Select Subnet -> Select NACL 

        -> Security Group 

            -> Firewall on Instance / Server Level

            -> Let's modify Security Group to block traffic 

            -> Select Instance -> Select Security -> Select Security group 

            -> Delete SSH Rule (This security group has no inbound rules)

            -> Add SSH Rule back and test connectivity

=============

    -> Requirement Given by EDIFY

	> Edify is going to setup the LMS App environment i.e servers on AWS, 
        their clients are from XYZ (REGION) Location

	> They are gonna host Servers

	> These servers are grouped into three subnets each with 4k servers

	> First Subnet is for web servers, around 4k

	> Second Subnet is for backend servers, around 4k

	> Third Subnet is for database servers, around 4k

	> In the future, they might add more number of subnets i.e cache subnets, load balancer subnet etc

	> The web servers and app servers needs to be communicated from internet

	> The database servers needs to be communicated only from App Servers, but not from internet
    
	> Coming to security of Web Servers, they should have only 
		> SSH traffic enabled for administration from internet
		> HTTP traffic for clients from internet

	> Coming to security of App Servers, they should have only 
		> SSH traffic enabled for administration from internet
		> HTTP traffic port 8080 for clients from internet

	> Coming to security of Database Servers, they should have only SSH access from app servers
		> SSH traffic enabled from web servers only
		> Postgres Database Traffic Allowed from App Servers
