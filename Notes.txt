    -> AWS - Amazon Web Services 

        -> Cloud Computing 

            -> Application has data 

                -> Data is in server (database,web, file storage etc )

                    -> Server 

                        -> Server is an machine where, Applications run 

                        -> Server is a computer system, that takes a request
                            and sends response 

                    -> Where is this Server ? 

                        -> Servers are hosted in Datacenters 

    -> Data Center 

        -> A data center is a building, a dedicated space within a building, 
        or a group of buildings used to house computer systems and 
        associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems.

    -> Physical Data Centers are Expensive & Hard To Maintain 

    -> Cloud Computing
    
        -> ‘The Cloud’ can also refer to Cloud computing is the 
        "on-demand" availability of compute power, database storage, 
        applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform 
        (AWS/AZURE/GCP/Oracle etc) via the "internet" with "pay-as-you-go" pricing.

        -> Cloud Computing is comparable to Online Ride Services 

    -> Cloud Offerings

        -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS 

            -> Hardware (2 cpu - 4 GB ram - 500 GB SSD)

        -> Platform As A Service - PAAS 

            -> Database Platform (MySQL Database, NoSQL Database, Java Application Platform)

        -> Software As A Service - SAAS 

            -> Direct Softwares (subscribe and pay)

        -> NOTE: Compare them to Online Ride Services like 
                    Uber: Bikes, Cars, Autos etc

=============

    -> Traditional Approach (Setting Up Application Infrastructure On Physical Datacenters)

        -> Amazon Ecommerce Application 

            -> Servers 
                +
            -> Storage 
                +
            -> Databases 
                +
            -> Networking 
                +
            -> Security 
                +
            -> etc 

    -> New Approach (Setting Up Application Infrastructure On Cloud Datacenters (AWS))

        -> Amazon Ecommerce Application 

            -> Servers      -   AWS EC2
                +                  +
            -> Storage      -   AWS S3 
                +                  +
            -> Databases    -   AWS RDS        ======>    Application
                +                  +
            -> Networking   -   AWS VPC 
                +                  +
            -> Security     -   AWS IAM
                +                  +
            -> etc          -   AWS etc 


    -> Application should have following characteristics (Four Pillars Of Cloud)

        -> Highly Available 

            -> High availability in AWS ensures that applications are 
                continuously accessible and operational

        -> Fault Tolerant 

            -> Fault tolerance in AWS refers to the ability of a system to 
                continue operating without interruption in the face of hardware failures

        -> Secured 

            -> Security in AWS refers to the measures taken to protect cloud resources, 
                data, and applications from unauthorized access.

        -> Scalable  

            -> Scalability in AWS refers to the ability of a system to handle 
                increasing workloads and accommodate growing demands. 


    -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS 

        -> AWS Global Infrastructure 

            -> Amazon Cloud Computing resources (servers, storage, databases etc) 
            are available across the world. 
            In simple terms if we see this https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/ 
            then Amazon Data Centers are available in different geographical locations.

        -> In terms of AWS, infrastructure is made up of 

            -> Regions 

            -> Availability Zones 

            -> Edge locations

        -> Regions

            -> Regions are designed to service AWS customers (or your users) 
                that are located closest to a region.

            -> Availability of Services are different for different AWS Regions.

            -> Price varies from region to region
