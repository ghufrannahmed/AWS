            -> Application has data 

                -> Data is in server (database,web, file storage etc )

                    -> Server 

                        -> Server is an machine where, Applications run 

                        -> Server is a computer system, that takes a request
                            and sends response 

                    -> Where is this Server ? 

                        -> Servers are hosted in Datacenters 

    -> Data Center 

        -> A data center is a building, a dedicated space within a building, 
        or a group of buildings used to house computer systems and 
        associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems.

    -> Physical Data Centers are Expensive & Hard To Maintain 

    -> Cloud Computing
    
        -> ‘The Cloud’ can also refer to Cloud computing is the 
        "on-demand" availability of compute power, database storage, 
        applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform 
        (AWS/AZURE/GCP/Oracle etc) via the "internet" with "pay-as-you-go" pricing.

        -> Cloud Computing is comparable to Online Ride Services 

    -> Cloud Offerings

        -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS 

            -> Hardware (2 cpu - 4 GB ram - 500 GB SSD)

        -> Platform As A Service - PAAS 

            -> Database Platform (MySQL Database, NoSQL Database, Java Application Platform)

        -> Software As A Service - SAAS 

            -> Direct Softwares (subscribe and pay)

        -> NOTE: Compare them to Online Ride Services like 
                    Uber: Bikes, Cars, Autos etc
